## 🖍️ Highlights & Annotations
> General intellectual humility (GIH) is the extent to which a person recognizes that they may not have all the possible information, that their thinking can be fallible, and ultimately that their beliefs may be incorrect (p. 2)

> more effectively (KrumreiMancuso et al., 2019; Leary et al., 2017; Porter & Schumann, 2018). Intellectual humility also benefits society by promoting empathy, gratitude, altruism, benevolence, universalism, support for compromise, and tolerance of opposing viewpoints (p. 2)

> Most important for this research, there is compelling evidence that intellectual humility weakens motivated reasoning and improves objectivity during information processing. (p. 3)

> The human mind is predisposed to intellectual arrogance (p. 4)

> naïve realism, in which people assume subjective perceptions of their environment are objective and free of bias (p. 4)

> Naïve realism causes individuals to believe their opinions result from objectively acquired knowledge of reality. There is even evidence that naïve realism leads people to believe that their subjective opinions are more reality based than those of others— such as evaluations of art (p. 4)

> individuals more deeply understand the rationale behind their beliefs, but they are unaware of the genuine basis for others’ opinions. (p. 4)

> dissenters hold perceptual biases. People are more likely to notice bias in others’ beliefs than their own ( (p. 4)

> This “bias blind spot” reflects the human tendency to overlook personal biases stemming from ideology, selfinterest, partisanship, or other sources. M (p. 4)

> introspection illusion i (p. 4)

> In contrast with intellectual arrogance, intellectual humility presumes the possibility that one’s own views may be faulty or incomplete. The intellectually humble acknowledge the possibility that disagreement can arise from a deficiency on their side, rather than assuming that deficiency lies with others. (p. 5)

> uncertainty about the cause of disagreement. (p. 5)

> nuanced and indeterminate answers to political and social problems (p. 5)

> When an opinion is held with arrogance, future information will be processed with directional (instead of accuracy) motivation. T (p. 5)

> motivated reasoning— (p. 5)

> The primary variables in this study are specific intellectual humility (SIH) and political hostility (PH). (p. 6)

> Aside from GIH, there were only two characteristics that consistently predicted SIH. Consistent with past research, liberals held beliefs with more humility than conservatives (p. 7)

> The second factor predicting SIH was formal education. (p. 7)

> ducation likely fosters intellectual humility by raising awareness of issue complexity and knowledge uncertainty (p. 7)

> stronger opinions correspond with lower intellectual humility (p. 8)

> those scoring higher in specific intellectual humility expressed less negative (more positive) feelings toward people who disagreed (p. 9)

> Specific intellectual humility remains a strong predictor of political hostility even after controlling for a variety of political and demographic variables. (p. 9)

> GIH showed a strong effect on issuespecific political hostility. (p. 10)

> The results thus far have shown that those holding particular views with more humility harbor less hostility toward dissenters. (p. 10)

> people harbor less negative feelings toward dissenters on issues where they feel more humble, while political hostility is more likely when that same person is intellectually arrogant (p. 11)

> a controlled experiment where a treatment condition raises intellectual humility. (p. 12)

> the treatment condition did not affect actual support for the policy, but it did affect people’s humility about their opinion and how they felt about people who disagreed with them (p. 13)

> expressions of humility are unlikely to change anyone’s minds, but they should increase humility and lower hostility (p. 13)

> How can we foster intellectual humility in society? (p. 13)

> efforts to raise both general intellectual humility and educational attainment will likely decrease political hostility on specific topics (p. 13)

> A more feasible approach is to help people recognize the level of uncertainty involved in any given political topic (p. 13)

> those who e they are wellinformed about a political topic hold their views with more intellectual arrogance. (p. 13)

> believe (p. 13)

> he less people believe they fully understand a topic, the less likely they are to hate people who hold opposing perspectives (p. 13)
