## 🖍️ Highlights & Annotations
> Limiting inquiry to one type of social group hinders the ability to draw conclusions about prejudice in general. (p. 40)

> experience more threat from outgroups, which is known to inspire prejudice. (p. 40)

> Consistent with these ideas, feelings of threat, the need for closure, and low Openness are all associated with greater prejudice towards racial and ethnic minorities, members of the LGBTQ communities, and generalized prejudice towards low status groups, among others (p. 40)

> The conclusion is simple: there is an ideological asymmetry to prejudice, with conservatives expressing more prejudice. (p. 41)

> predicts that regardless of political orientation, people will express prejudice against groups and individuals they see as holding different values or beliefs. (p. 41)

**Note:** This is consistent with evolutionary explanations from the "Can Race be Erased?" article. Human prejudice and Us Vs Them encoding is not a trait of a particular social group but is a universal aspect of human cognition. Expression of prejudice is a human tendency that was shaped by the EEA.

> similarity breeds liking [21] and contributes to our recognition of shared group membership [22 ]. This robust effect might be taken to suggest that regardless of whether they are liberal or conservative, people will express prejudice towards dissimilar groups (p. 41)

> classic work on the role of social identities in producing biases against the ingroup and favoring the outgroup suggest that regardless of whether they are liberal or conservative, people express prejudice towards outgroups (p. 41)

> value threats, in general, are associated with prejudice (p. 41)

> For instance, low Openness to experience is associated with prejudice against groups seen as socially unconventional (e.g. atheists, gay men and lesbians), whereas high Openness is either associated with prejudice against groups seen as socially conventional (e.g. military personnel, Evangelical Christians) or is unassociated with prejudice [1 ,48]. Whereas high disgust sensitivity is associated with prejudice against groups that threaten traditional sexual morality, low disgust sensitivity is associated with prejudice against groups that uphold traditional sexual morality (p. 41)

**Note:** coalition biases track shifting alliances. Dissimilar views and identities are met with animosity as a function of dissimilarity not the fact of being a conservative alone.

> Agreeableness was associated with prejudice against a wide array of groups that varied in their perceived status, ideology, and other traits, suggesting it captures a broad-based prejudice (p. 41)

**Note:** Agreeableness is an exception to the rule.

> If dissimilarity is one of the primary driving forces for conflict, a reappraisal perspective would suggest encouraging participants to detach from the feelings that dissimilarity and disagreement inspire. (p. 43)

**Note:** Directly relates to Thesis! Detachment from feelings, a reappraisal facilitated by a human universals intervention!

> We believe there is room in social psychology for both a focus on prejudice as a broad phenomenon, along with multiple forms of specific prejudices (e.g. toward and among different types of groups). Work that focuses on a narrower range of prejudices can be well conceived and conducted, but it must be careful to limit its conclusions regarding its generalizeability to the relevant prejudices. (p. 43)

**Note:** I share this intuition!
