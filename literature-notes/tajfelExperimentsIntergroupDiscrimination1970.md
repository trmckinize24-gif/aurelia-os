> ntergroup discrimination is a feature  of most modern societies. The phe nomenon is depressingly similar re gardless of the constitution of the "in group" and of the "outgroup" that is per ceived as being somehow different. (p. 1)

> The fact is that behavior toward outgroups shows the same monotonous similarity as attitudes do, across a diver sity of socioeconomic conditions. This apparent diversity may, of course, ob scure an underlying common factor of "rational" conflict, of struggle to pre serve a status quo favorable to oneself or to obtain an equitable share of social opportunities and benefits. Another kind of underlying regularity is nonetheless common to a variety of social situations and is an important psychological effect of our sociocultural milieu. (p. 3)

> An individual constructs his own "web of social affilia tions" by applying principles of order (p. 3)

> Perhaps the most important prin ciple of the subjective social order we construct for ourselves is the classifica tion of groups as "we" and "they"-as in groups (any number of them to which we happen to belong) and outgroups. (p. 3)

> Whenever we are confronted with a situation to which some form of intergroup categori zation appears directly relevant, we are likely to act in a manner that discrimi (p. 3)

> The results were striking. In making their intergroup choices a large majority of the subjects, in all groups in both con ditions, gave more money to members of their own group than to members of the other group. (p. 6)

> As soon as this dif ferentiation was involved, however, they discriminated in favor of the ingroup. (p. 6)

> Out group discrimination is extraordinarily easy to trigger off. In some previous studies of group conflict, such as one conducted by Muzafer Sherif at the Uni versity of Oklahoma, groups had to be placed in intense competition for sev eral days for such results to occur [see "Experiments in Group Conflict," by Muzafer Sherif; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, November, 1956]; (p. 7)

> Behavior is never motive less, but it is a crude overSimplification to think that motives in social situations include no more than calculations of self-interest or that they can be derived from a few supposedly universal human drives such as aggression toward the out sider, the need to affiliate and so on. To behave socially is a complex business. It involves a long learning process; it is based on the manipulation of symbols and abstractions; it implies the capacity for modification of conduct when the situation changes-and social situations never remain static. To behave appTO ]Jl'iately is therefore a powerful social motive, and attempting to do so means to behave according to one's best under standing of the situation. Judgments of what is appropriate are determined by social norms, or sets of expectations. (p. 7)
