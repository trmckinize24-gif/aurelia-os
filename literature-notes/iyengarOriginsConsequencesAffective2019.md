> Ordinary Americans increasingly dislike and distrust those from the other party. (p. 130)

> origins of affective polarization to the power of partisanship as a social identity, and explain the factors that intensify partisan animus. We also explore the consequences of affective polarization, highlighting how partisan affect influences attitudes and behaviors well outside the political sphere. (p. 130)

> ature in social psychology demonstrates that any such in-group/out-group distinction, even one based on the most trivial of shared characteristics, triggers both positive feelings for the in group and negative evaluations of the out group (see, e.g., Billig & Tajfel 1973). The more salient the group to the sense of personal identity, the stronger these intergroup divisions (Gaertner et al. 1993). (p. 130)

> Indeed, in some settings, affective polarization can increase while ideological divisions shrink (Levendusky & Malhotra 2016a). While there are important connections between affective and ideological polarization (Abramowitz & Webster 2016), to which we return below, they are theoretically and empirically distinct concepts. In this article, we focus exclusively on the affective dimension of polarization. (p. 131)

> Typically, respondents are asked to rate Democrats and Republicans (or the Democratic and Republican Parties) on a 101-point scale ranging from cold (0) to warm (100). Affective polarization is then computed as the difference between the score given to the party of the respondent and the score given to the opposing party, which we also refer to as the out party. In the ANES time series (see Figure 1), this measure shows a significant increase in affective polarization since 1980, rising from 22.64 degrees in 1978 to 40.87 degrees in 2016 (Iyengar et al. 2012) (p. 131)

> It is particularly noteworthy that (a) the change is not that people like their own party more over time; rather, there is an increase in out-party animus, especially in recent years, and (b) affective polarization actually decreased between 2012 and 2016. Other over-time measures of partisan affect show similar patterns (e.g., Pew Research Center 2017). (p. 131)

> Understanding the precise limitations of social distance measures is an important topic for future research. (p. 132)

> When most Democrats are liberals and most Republicans are conservatives, copartisans are less likely to encounter conflicting political ideas and identities (Roccas & Brewer 2002) and are more likely to see nonidentifiers as socially distant. (p. 134)

> This decline of cross-cutting identities is at the root of affective polarization, according to Mason (2015, 2018b) (p. 134)

> While reinforcing social identities seem to be a key factor explaining affective polarization, other work finds that ideological polarization also impacts affective polarization (Rogowski & Sutherland 2016, Bougher 2017) (p. 134)

> Partisan outlets—many of which depict the opposing party in harsh terms, often comparing out partisans to Nazis and Communists (Berry & Sobieraj 2014) and focusing disproportionately on out-party scandals (real or imagined)—inculcate hostility toward the out group (Puglisi & Snyder 2011). (p. 134)

> First, the mainstream media has increasingly focused on polarization. According to one content analysis, there are roughly 20% more stories about polarization in America today than there were at the turn of the twenty-first century (Levendusky & Malhotra 2016a). (p. 135)

> Across recent election cycles, people were 50–150% more affectively polarized by election day than they were a year earlier. Additionally, by identifying people who live in the designated market area of a neighboring battleground state, Sood & Iyengar (2016) show that political advertisements, and especially negative advertising, have particularly strong effects on affective polarization (see also (p. 135)

> Longitudinal survey data have shown that people self-report that they are less comfortable with social relationships with out partisans. According to Iyengar et al. (2012), the percentage of Americans who would be somewhat or very unhappy if their child married someone of the opposite party has increased by about 35 percentage points over the last 50 years, with Republicans especially sensitive to crossparty marriage (p. 136)

> Behavioral data from smartphone activity confirms that Americans are averse to cross-partisan dialogue within their families, especially in the wake of the 2016 election (Chen & Rohla 2018). (p. 136)

> Survey data from the Pew Research Center (2017) suggest this is unlikely; about 64% of Democrats and 55% of Republicans say they have “just a few” or “no” close friends who are from the other political party. Huber & Malhotra (2017) (p. 137)

> Chopik & Motyl (2016) find that living in a politically incongruent area made it more difficult for people to form friendships (p. 137)

> Partisanship may spill over into professional decisions as well. In medicine, Hersh & Goldenberg (2016) find that Republican and Democratic physicians give different advice to patients on politicized health issues such as abortion, but not on apolitical health topics. On the patient side, Lerman et al. (2017) leverage longitudinal data and find that Republicans were less likely than Democrats to enroll in health insurance exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act. (p. 139)

> There are two important exceptions, however. First, there is evidence that affective polarization and out-party animus fuel political activity: Individuals’ dislike for the opposing party encourages them to participate more in politics (Iyengar & Krupenkin 2018). Second, Hetherington & Rudolph (2015) show that affective polarization undermines trust on the part of the party that is out of power, and hence makes governing more complex. (p. 139)

> If misperceptions about party composition increase partisan animus, it is possible that correcting them could reduce affective polarization. Happily, this is exactly what scholars find. When Ahler & Sood (2018) correct respondents’ misperceptions, respondents think the other party is less extreme, and affective polarization decreases (i.e., they like the other party more) (p. 140)

> Normally, Democrats and Republicans perceive each other as members of a disliked partisan out group. But they are also members of a common group: Americans. If Democrats and Republicans see one another as Americans, rather than partisans, they move from out-group members to in-group ones, and hence group-based partisan animus should fade. (p. 140)

> More generally, the evidence suggests that making partisanship and politics less salient—and emphasizing other factors—can potentially change behavior as well. (p. 140)



**Note:** Prior attempts to counter AP involves priming and making salient common identities and making political identities less salient. These kinds of interventions often show short term reductions in AP but the MCD model is an attempt at establishing a network of meta cognitive traits that act as buffers against intuitive, visceral, automatic prejudicial judgements about ones outgroup which leads to negative bias, in addition to questioning the intuitive, visceral, automatic favorable judgements made about in group members. The Person high in metacognitive traits across the network is more likely to analyze and seek to understand the mental processes (heuristics, appealing to work in DPT) that encourage cognitive biases across various contexts. The internal socrates idea. An interlocutor can often help an indiviudal come closer to more rational conclusions about a topic through dialogue, but I am looking to develop an internal interlocutor that asks the why questions more often.

> There is ample evidence that political judgment is subject to a negativity bias (Soroka 2014), implying that party polarization is driven by out-group hostility. However, there is also evidence that in some situations, partisan bias is prompted more by in-group love (Lelkes & Westwood 2017). (p. 142)
