## 🖍️ Highlights & Annotations
> This paper examines how an increasingly socially homogeneous set of parties has generated an increasingly emotionally reactive—and therefore “affectively” polarized—electorate. The specific emotions examined here are enthusiasm and anger, chosen because these particular emotions have been repeatedly shown to drive action, political engagement, and partisan thinking (MacKuen et al. 2010; Valentino et al. 2011; Banks 2014; Groenendyk and Banks 2014). (p. 2)

> The difference between the polarization of attitudes and the polarization of Americans on a social and emotional level is an important distinction. (p. 2)

> Groenendyk and Banks (2014) found that anger and enthusiasm, motivated by partisan identity, drive political participation. Valentino et al. (2011) found anger to be a potent motivator for political action. MacKuen et al. (2010) found that anger can lead to “defense of convictions, solidarity with allies, and opposition to accommodation” (440), while Weeks (2015) found that anger leads to more partisan motivated reasoning. However, less research has examined the sources of these emotions. Recent work by Huddy, Mason, and Aaroe (2015) found that a partisan social identity, particularly when the social element of partisanship is examined, can drive strong emotional reactions to political messages. (p. 3)

> As I demonstrate below, in recent years people are increasingly likely to be angered by the opposing party’s candidate, and to feel proud of their own party’s candidate, and the difference between their feelings toward the two parties’ candidates has been increasing as well. (p. 3)

> To begin, these emotions can be understood as a very natural, identity-based reaction to the messages that partisans receive on a regular basis. Huddy, Mason, and Aaroe (2015) have found that when the status of a party is threatened, the strongest partisans react with extreme levels of anger. (p. 4)

> When those same partisans are exposed to a message about party victory, they feel the strongest levels of enthusiasm. This work has its origins in social identity theory, which explains that a social identity is a psychological connection to a particular group of people (Tajfel and Turner 1979). (p. 4)

> The current political environment is therefore well suited to inducing angry and enthusiastic emotional reactions among those who feel identified with the competitors. (p. 4)

> These theories conform with early research finding that voters who are members of groups that conflict with their party are less strongly partisan (Campbell et al. 1960; Powell 1976), and that these “cross-cutting cleavages” mitigate social conflict (Lipset 1960; Nordlinger 1972; Dahl 1981). This research suggests that as long as the social divisions in society are crosscutting, partisans of opposing parties are still able to generally get along. However, once these cleavages begin to align along a single dimension, partisan conflict is expected to increase substantially. The cross-cutting divisions work to moderate political rancor. (p. 5)

> Furthermore, those same increasingly sorted individuals did not grow more extreme in their issue positions. They were not, therefore, angrier simply because they cared more about issues. They were angry as a result of sorting. When a single person went through a process of aligning their partisan and ideological identities, they came out the other end angrier than they entered, but no more policy extreme. (p. 5)

> Our emotional relationships with our opponents must be addressed before we can even hope to make the important policy compromises that are required for governing. And those relationships are increasingly dependent on how well our identities line up behind our parties. (p. 18)
