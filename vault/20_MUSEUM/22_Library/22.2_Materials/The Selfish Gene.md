**👤 Author:** [[Richard Dawkins]]
**📍 Full Notes:** On reMarkable

### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>[[Evolution]] is best understood from a gene's perspective, viewing organisms as survival machines built by genes to perpetuate themselves, with [[Genes]]s as the fundamental units of selection, selfishly promoting their self replication over the organisms well being, even explaining apparent altruism as gene-level strategies for survival.
