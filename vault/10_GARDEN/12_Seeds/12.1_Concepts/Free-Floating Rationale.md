# ⚛️ Free-Floating Rationale

**🔗 Related:** [[ ]]

---

### 💡 Definition
> A free-floating rationale is an apparent reason, purpose, or function that emerges from evolutionary or algorithmic processes without being represented, understood, or intended by any conscious agent.

### 📝 Key Insight
* Free-floating rationales explain why behaviors or structures _make sense_ (serve a function) even when no mind ever planned or comprehended that function.
- Natural selection generates free-floating rationales by retaining designs that work, not by consulting reasons or goals.
- Recognizing free-floating rationales helps dissolve the intuition that purpose always requires a purposeful mind.
