### 💡 Definition
> A cognitive process of transferring information or meaning from a particular subject (the source) to another (the target). Structurally, it is the identification of a shared **relational pattern** between two otherwise dissimilar systems. In formal logic, it often takes the form $A : B :: C : D$ (A is to B as C is to D). In cognitive science, analogy is considered the core mechanism of thought—it is how the brain uses "old" knowledge (existing neural maps) to navigate "new" territory by recognizing structural similarities.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **The Core of Cognition:** As argued in _Surfaces and Essences_, analogy is not merely a rhetorical flourish; it is the fuel and fire of thinking. We cannot understand a new concept without mapping it onto a pre-existing mental model. Whether explaining an atom as a "solar system" or the brain as a "computer," we are relying on **isomorphism**—asserting that the _relationships_ in one system mirror the _relationships_ in the other, even if the physical substrates are completely different.
