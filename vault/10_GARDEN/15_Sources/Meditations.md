### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>This text was never intended for publication; it is a private journal of spiritual exercises ("To Himself") written by the Roman Emperor to maintain psychological order amidst war and plague. The central thesis is that while we cannot control external events (health, reputation, the actions of others), we have absolute sovereignty over our **judgments** about those events. By aligning our will with the _Logos_ (Universal Reason) and stripping away emotional coloration from our perceptions, we can maintain tranquility (_Ataraxia_) and act virtuously regardless of circumstance.

### 🧠 Concepts Extracted
*(Concepts linked here will show in Graph View)*
*  **[[The Dichotomy of Control]]:** The cardinal rule: distinguishing between what is up to us (our opinions, impulses, desires) and what is not (bodies, possessions, reputation). (Direct link to [[Internal Locus of Control]]).
- **[[Objective Representation]]:** (_Phantasia Kataleptike_). The practice of describing things exactly as they are, without adding value judgments. E.g., "This is not a 'delicious vintage wine,' it is fermented grape juice."
- **[[Memento Mori]]:** The meditation on mortality. "You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think."
- **[[The View from Above]]:** A visualization exercise of zooming out to a planetary scale to realize the insignificance of personal anxieties in the grand scheme of deep time.
- **[[Amor Fati]]:** The love of fate. Not merely enduring what happens, but embracing it as the necessary fuel for your own development.
