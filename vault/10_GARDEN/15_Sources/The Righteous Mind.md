### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>Human morality is not primarily a function of logic/reason, but of intuition/emotion. The mind is divided like a rider on an elephant: the **Elephant** (automatic intuition) moves where it pleases, and the **Rider** (conscious reasoning) acts as the press secretary, justifying the elephant's path after the fact. Furthermore, morality is an evolutionary adaptation designed to bind groups together, which simultaneously blinds them to the validity of opposing moral matrices. To understand political division, one must recognize that while Liberals rely on only three moral foundations (Care, Fairness, Liberty), Conservatives rely on all six (adding Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity).
