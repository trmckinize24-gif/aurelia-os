### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>The diversity of life is not the result of special creation, but of a blind, mechanical process acting over deep time. Darwin argues that because (1) individuals within a population vary, (2) traits are heritable, and (3) more offspring are born than can survive (The Malthusian struggle), those with advantageous variations will statistically survive and reproduce more often. Over generations, this **Natural Selection** accumulates changes, leading to the divergence of species from common ancestors. This destroyed the concept of "Teleology" (purpose) in nature, replacing it with [[Algorithm]]ic design. ([[Evolutionary Biology]], [[Evolution]])

### 🧠 Concepts Extracted
- **[[Natural Selection]]:** The mechanism of preservation. "This preservation of favorable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection."
- **[[Common Descent]]:** The theory that all living organisms on Earth are descendants of a single ancestral origin. Life is not a ladder (Scala Naturae) but a branching tree.
- **[[Gradualism]]:** (_Natura non facit saltum_). The assertion that nature does not make jumps; complex organs (like the eye) are formed by the accumulation of countless slight, successive modifications.
- **[[The Struggle for Existence]]:** The concept derived from Malthus: resources are linear, but reproduction is exponential. This guarantees a lethal competition that acts as the "sieve" for selection.
- **[[Divergence of Character]]:** The principle that competition is most severe between closely related forms, pushing them to adapt to different niches (ecological specialization) to minimize overlap.
