## 📚 KNOWLEDGE INTAKE
*Process your Cornell Notes here. 15 mins max.*

**SOURCE:** [[Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking]] by [[Daniel Dennett]]

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[Sturgeon's Law]]
* **Concept:** [[Ockham's Razor]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>These two tools are simple yet effective heuristic's for clear thinking and can apply to numerous situations of reasoning. Sturgeon's law is related to ones character as well as their ability to formulate opinions worth listening to. Ockham's razor is a legendary tool for a reason, and the use of this razor can be the difference between a plausible theory and a conspiratorial one, and that's not trivial.
