**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>AI first developer is an emerging field with huge upside potential. Like all things there is no secret hack to becoming a full blown software engineer even with AI tools providing a rather useful crutch. I do want to use AI for efficiency and to stay on top of the emerging trends in AI research, usage, and societal impact, but I would rather become an expert in this field over the next 20-30 years than stay stuck as a novice trying to hack the system. The AI overview podcast provides a clear roadmap to success in AI developer careers.
