## 📚 KNOWLEDGE INTAKE


**SOURCE:** [[Psychology - Biological & Cognitive Foundations]] audio overview [[Your_Brain_Constructs_Reality_In_The_Dark.m4a]]

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[Sensation]] + [[Sense Organ]]
* **Concept:** [[Perception]]
* **Concept:** [[Transduction]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>For this daily log I am going to actively recall a section from the audio overview for the Notebook above. On my Remarkable I wrote "We do not perceive reality as it is. We are subject to a user illusion whereby the brain performs complex actions that generate the experience of mind in the human organism. Organisms are [[Survival Machines]] being manipulated by their initial programming [[Gene]]s, which are the fundamental unit of [[Natural Selection]]. The expression of genetics is altered by environment/experiences ([[Epigenetics]]). [[Evolutionary Biology]] is [[Engineering]] and [[Consciousness]] itself is a mysterious phenomenon that appears to emerge from the [[Structural-Functional Organization]] of the [[Nervous System]]. The apparent [[Stream of Consciousness]] ([[William James]]) that humans experience is the result of the brain integrating information in a binding process. [[Transduction]], [[Sensation]] & [[Perception]] are fundamental processes that lead to the subjective psychological experience."
