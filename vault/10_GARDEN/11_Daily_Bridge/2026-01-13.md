## 📚 KNOWLEDGE INTAKE
*Process your Cornell Notes here. 15 mins max.*

**SOURCE:** [[The Selfish Gene]] by [[Richard Dawkins]]

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[Aggression]]
* **Concept:** [[Game Theory]]
* **Concept:** [[War of Attrition]]
* **Concept:** [[Evolutionary Stable Strategy]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>Dawkins does an amazing job of demonstrating how the [[Evolution]] of the [[Evolutionary Stable Strategy]] is formed, through the lens of [[Game Theory]]. He explains that social phenomena such as altruism and [[Aggression]] are explained best when you consider that [[Gene]]s of any particular [[Survival Machines]] must contend with the genes of others (same species or not). 
>He uses a game theory tournament example from [[John Maynard Smith]] to illustrate how the [[Evolutionary Stable Strategy]] becomes the predominant strategy through a series of oscillations between various strategies vying for dominance in a given population, emphasizing that there are mathematical formulas which explain the probability distributions of strategies employed in the tournament for greater fitness and evolutionary success.
