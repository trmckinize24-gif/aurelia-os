**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>This deep dive is extremely informative and it sheds light on the positive and negative effects of AI usage on learning habits/outcomes. AI ought to act as a mirror, and one must resist the temptation to use it as a magical oracle, because when we offload our cognitive efforts entirely to these machines, our ability to think critically atrophies, and we become dependent. I aim to utilize AI strategically and in a way where I do not kid myself into thinking that I am some kind of genius simply because I have Google Gemini in my pocket. I will now use the information about the ways in which AI can be destructive to my abilities as a thinker/problem solver to design protocols that emphasize inserting my own cognition into the learning loop. I will use [[Active Recall]] and other evidence based techniques for better learning and comprehension. There is a connection here between the chapter in [[Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking]] where [[Daniel Dennett]] urges us to use lay audiences as decoys. This gives experts the opportunity to really learn their material well so that they can teach it to non experts without the fear of overexplaining (and therefore insulting other experts) or talking past a peer.
