## 📚 KNOWLEDGE INTAKE
*Process your Cornell Notes here. 15 mins max.*

**SOURCE:** [[Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking]] by [[Daniel Dennett]]

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[Reductio ad Absurdum]]
* **Concept:** [[Conjecture]]
* **Concept:** [[Implication]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>Dennett frames Reductio ad Absurdum as a tool for pressure testing ones own statements and that of opponents in an argument. If you can reduce an argument to absurdity by taking the implications to the extreme, then the argument is likely not as solid as it looks at the superficial level. Reductio ad Absurdum shows up quite a lot in casual conversation, though I plan to leverage this tool to rigorously test my own ideas.
