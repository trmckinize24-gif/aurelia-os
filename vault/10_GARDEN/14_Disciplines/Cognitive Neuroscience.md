# 🧠 Cognitive Neuroscience

### 🧐 Definition (The Scope)
>The scientific field that seeks to understand the biological processes that underlie cognition, with a specific focus on the neural connections in the brain which are involved in mental processes.

**The Bridge:** If **Cognitive Psychology** asks _"What is the algorithm for memory?"_ and **Neuroscience** asks _"How do neurons fire?"_, **Cognitive Neuroscience** asks _"Where physically in the brain is the memory algorithm running?"_ It emerged in the late 1970s, largely driven by the invention of non-invasive brain imaging tools that allowed scientists to watch the brain "think" in real-time.

### 🔑 Core Concepts (The Bricks)
- **[[Localization of Function]]:** The principle that specific cognitive functions are served by specific areas of the brain. While "Phrenology" (bumps on the skull) was pseudoscience, the underlying idea was correct. For example, the **Fusiform Face Area (FFA)** is dedicated almost exclusively to recognizing faces.
    
- **[[Hemispheric Lateralization]] (Split-Brain):** The discovery that the two hemispheres of the brain have distinct specializations.
    
    - **Left:** Logic, Language (Syntax), Linear processing.
        
    - **Right:** Spatial reasoning, Face recognition, Prosody (Tone), Holistic processing.
        
    - This was famously demonstrated by **Michael Gazzaniga** and **Roger Sperry** in patients whose corpus callosum had been severed.
        
- **[[Neuroimaging]] (The Toolset):** The field is defined by its tools, which trade off between **Spatial Resolution** (Where?) and **Temporal Resolution** (When?).
    
    - **fMRI:** Measures blood flow (BOLD signal). High spatial resolution (mm), low temporal resolution (seconds). Good for "Where."
        
    - **EEG:** Measures electrical activity at the scalp. Low spatial resolution, high temporal resolution (milliseconds). Good for "When."
        
- **[[Mirror Neurons]]:** Neurons that fire both when an individual acts _and_ when the individual observes the same action performed by another. This provides a biological basis for **Empathy** and **Social Learning**.
### 📚 Foundational Texts
- **[[The Cognitive Neuroscience]]** by **Michael Gazzaniga** (The massive handbook that defined the field).
    
- **[[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]** by **Oliver Sacks** (Case studies of specific localized brain damage).
    
- **[[Phantoms in the Brain]]** by **V.S. Ramachandran** (Explaining consciousness through its anomalies).
    
- **[[Descartes' Error]]** by **Antonio Damasio** (Demonstrating that emotion is essential for rational decision-making).
### 🧪 Unresolved Questions
- The Resolution Gap: fMRI measures blood, not electricity. We are effectively trying to understand a computer processor by measuring which parts of it get hot. We still lack a non-invasive way to measure specific neural circuits in humans.
    
- The Binding Problem: We know the brain processes color, shape, and motion in different areas (V4, V1, V5). How does it instantly "bind" these into a single unified perception of a "Red Ferrari driving by"?
