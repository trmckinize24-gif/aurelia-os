### 💡 Definition
> A theoretical framework developed by **Barry Zimmerman** (2000) that conceptualizes learning not as a linear event, but as a continuous, three-phase cycle of self-regulation. It explains how students master complex skills by monitoring their performance and adjusting their strategies based on feedback.

**The Three Phases:**

1. **Forethought (Before):** The planning phase. This involves **Task Analysis** (setting goals, planning strategies) and **Self-Motivation** (believing you can do it, i.e., Self-Efficacy).
    
2. **Performance (During):** The execution phase. This involves **Self-Control** (focusing attention, avoiding distractions) and **Self-Observation** (tracking what you are doing in real-time).
    
3. **Self-Reflection (After):** The evaluation phase. This involves **Self-Judgment** (comparing the result to the goal) and **Self-Reaction** (deciding how to feel about it and what to change next time).

### 📝 Key Insight

>**Attribution is Everything:** The critical pivot point in the cycle occurs in the **Self-Reflection** phase, specifically regarding **Causal Attribution** (why did I fail?).

- **Adaptive Learners** attribute failure to _Strategy_ ("I used the wrong method"). This leads to a new plan in the Forethought phase (Positive Feedback Loop).
    
- **Defensive Learners** attribute failure to _Ability_ ("I am just stupid"). This leads to avoidance and disengagement in the Forethought phase (Negative Feedback Loop).
    
- Therefore, the goal of Zimmerman's model is to shift the learner's focus from "How smart am I?" to "How effective was my strategy?"
