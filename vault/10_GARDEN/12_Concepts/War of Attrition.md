# ⚛️ War of Attrition

**🔗 Related:** [[Evolutionary Stable Strategy]], [[John Maynard Smith]], [[The Selfish Gene]], [[Resource Holding Potential]], [[Signaling Theory]], [[The Poker Face]]

### 💡 Definition
> A game-theoretic model of [[Aggression]] in which two contestants compete for a resource of a certain value ($V$) by displaying (waiting) rather than fighting.

- **The Mechanism:** The winner is the individual who is willing to persist the longest.
    
- **The Cost:** Both players accrue costs ($C$) continuously as time passes (lost energy, missed opportunities, exposure to predators).
    

unlike the [[Hawk-Dove Game]] (which models escalation to violence), the War of Attrition models "Ritualized Aggression"—staring contests, bird song duels, or posturing. The game ends when one player gives up; the winner gets the resource minus the cost of waiting, while the loser pays the cost of waiting but gets nothing.

### 📝 Key Insight
- **The "Poker Face" Necessity:** The crucial finding by Maynard Smith is that there is no fixed "optimal time" to wait.
    
    - If you always waited exactly 5 minutes, your opponent would evolve to wait 5 minutes and 1 second.
        
    - Therefore, the **[[Evolutionary Stable Strategy]] (ESS)** is to be **Unpredictable**. You must select your waiting time randomly according to a specific probability curve (an exponential distribution).
        
    - Crucially, this means you must not signal when you are about to give up. If you signaled "I am getting tired," the opponent would know to hold on just a second longer to win. Thus, evolution favors a totally unreadable expression—the biological origin of the **Stoic** "Poker Face."
