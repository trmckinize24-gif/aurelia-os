### 💡 Definition
> The process of organizing, identifying, and interpreting sensory information in order to represent and understand the presented environment. While **Sensation** is the passive reception of raw signals (bottom-up), **Perception** is the active construction of a model (top-down).

- **The Process:** The brain takes the noisy, ambiguous electrical spikes from the sensory organs and matches them against stored knowledge and expectations to create a coherent experience.
    
- **The Result:** We do not perceive the world "as it is"; we perceive it "as it is useful for us to see it." For example, we see a "Chair" (an object for sitting), not a collection of wooden angles and light frequencies.

### 📝 Key Insight
- **"Controlled Hallucination":** As neuroscientist **Anil Seth** argues, perception is not a window onto reality; it is a "Controlled Hallucination." The brain is constantly generating a prediction of what is out there (Simulating). It uses sensory data merely to correct the prediction errors.
	- **Visual Illusions** prove this: In the **Kanizsa Triangle**, you "see" a white triangle that isn't actually drawn. Your brain hallucinates the borders because that is the most likely explanation for the arrangement of the Pac-Man shapes
	- **Implication:** Reality as we experience it is a creative act. When we agree on our hallucinations, we call it "Reality." When we don't, we call it "Psychosis."
