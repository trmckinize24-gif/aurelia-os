# ⚛️ Simulation

### 💡 Definition
> The imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. While a **[[Model]]** is the static representation (the map/rules), a **Simulation** is the dynamic execution of that model (the journey/gameplay). It involves generating an artificial history of the system, observing the observation of inference to draw conclusions concerning the operating characteristics of the real system. In **[[Artificial Intelligence]]**, this is used for training agents (e.g., teaching a robot to walk in a physics engine before the real world). In biological**[[Cognition]]**, it is what the[[ Neocortex]] does when you "imagine" a future scenario to test a decision.

### 📝 Key Insight
- **The "What If" Machine:** The primary evolutionary and engineering utility of simulation is **Low-Cost Failure**.
- **In Engineering:** You can crash a simulated airplane 1,000 times to find a structural flaw without killing anyone or spending a dollar on aluminum.
- **In Biology:** As philosopher **Karl Popper** famously noted, the evolution of mental simulation allowed our hypotheses to "die in our stead." Instead of jumping off a cliff to see if it's safe, we simulate the jump, predict the pain, and choose not to jump. Simulation is the engine of **Counterfactual Reasoning**—the ability to explore worlds that do not exist to improve the one that does.
