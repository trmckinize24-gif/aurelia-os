### 💡 Definition
> Defined as a higher order skill whereby an individual actively sets goals, monitors progress, and self evaluates their performance when attempting to acquire new skills and/or learn new knowledge. Self-Regulated learning is especially important to me as someone who wants to be a lifelong learner with intellectual humility and openness to revision based on new evidence. In order to ensure that I can truly learn complex topics of interest on my own or in a way where experts can guide me , supplementing my own fruitful efforts to learn new things, I have to deeply understand the learning process. As a heavy AI user I can either become extremely competent and efficient in learning new things or I can bury my own grave by using AI as an oracle instead of a mirror. 

/t-concept
>The active, constructive process whereby learners set goals for their learning and then attempt to monitor, regulate, and control their cognition, motivation, and behavior, guided and constrained by their goals and the contextual features in the environment.

- **The Core Shift:** It represents the transition from being a passive recipient of information ("being taught") to an active agent of knowledge ("learning").
    
- **The Mechanism:** It is often visualized using **Zimmerman’s Cyclical Phases**, which turns learning into a continuous feedback loop rather than a linear event.



### 📝 Key Insight
- **The [[Cybernetics]] of the Self:** SRL is essentially a **[[Negative Feedback Loop]]** applied to the brain.
    
    1. **Forethought Phase (Planning):** The user sets a goal ("I want to understand [[Game Theory]]") and selects a strategy.
        
    2. **Performance Phase (Monitoring):** The user executes the strategy (Reading _The Selfish Gene_) while engaging in **Metacognitive Monitoring** ("Do I actually understand this paragraph, or am I just reading the words?").
        
    3. **Self-Reflection Phase (Evaluating):** The user evaluates the outcome against the standard ("I failed the quiz") and adjusts the strategy for the next loop ("I need to take notes, not just read").
        
- **The Failure Point:** Most students fail not because they lack "intelligence" (hardware), but because they lack "regulation" (software). They stay in the **Performance Phase** (rereading notes repeatedly) without ever entering the **Reflection Phase** to check if the strategy is actually working.
