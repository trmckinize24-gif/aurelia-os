### 💡 Definition
> A strategy which, if adopted by a population, cannot be invaded by any alternative mutant strategy. Coined by **John Maynard Smith** (and popularized by **Richard Dawkins**), it is effectively a **Nash Equilibrium** applied to evolutionary biology. In the context of aggression, it explains why a population doesn't consist entirely of passive pacifists ("Doves") or hyper-aggressive killers ("Hawks").

- A population of all Doves is not stable because a single mutant Hawk would dominate it (High payoff).
    
- A population of all Hawks is not stable because the risk of injury is too high when Hawks fight Hawks (Negative payoff).
    
- The **ESS** is the precise ratio (e.g., 70% Doves / 30% Hawks) or the mixed behavioral strategy where the payoffs balance out, and no new strategy can outperform the status quo.

### 📝 Key Insight
- **Stability $\neq$ Optimality:** The most profound takeaway from the ESS framework is that evolution does not optimize for the "best" outcome for the species (Group Selection); it optimizes for **Stability**.
	- A society of 100% altruistic Doves would arguably be "better" for the species as a whole (no one gets hurt).
	- However, because that society is **Unstable** (liable to invasion by a single cheater), evolution will not select for it. Nature settles on the strategy that is immune to treachery, even if that strategy involves some waste and conflict. As Dawkins notes, an ESS is a "stalemate" where no individual can improve their standing by deviating.
