### 💡 Definition
> The physiological process by which sensory receptors detect stimuli from the external environment (or internal body state) and convert them into neural impulses. It is the "raw data" entry point of the nervous system.

- **The Mechanism:** It relies on specialized cells (photoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors) that perform **Transduction**—converting physical energy (light waves, sound waves, pressure) into electrochemical signals (Action Potentials).

- **The Distinction:** Sensation is distinct from **Perception**. Sensation is the hardware detecting the signal (e.g., "Retina detects 700nm light"). Perception is the software interpreting the signal (e.g., "I see a red apple").

### 📝 Key Insight

- **The "Labeled Line" Principle:** The brain distinguishes between different types of sensations (e.g., sight vs. smell) not by the signal itself (which is always just an electrical spike), but by the specific pathway the signal travels.
	- An action potential coming from the optic nerve is always interpreted as "Light."
	    
	- An action potential coming from the auditory nerve is always interpreted as "Sound."
	    
	- This is why getting punched in the eye can make you "see stars"—the mechanical pressure artificially triggers the optic nerve, and the brain has no choice but to interpret that electricity as a visual flash. The nature of the sensation is determined by the **destination**, not the **input**.
