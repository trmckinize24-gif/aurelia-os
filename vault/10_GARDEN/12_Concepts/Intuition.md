### 💡 Definition
> The ability to acquire knowledge without recourse to conscious reasoning. In **Cognitive Science**, intuition is defined as the rapid processing of information by **System 1**. It is the brain's "Autocomplete" function. When you face a situation, your brain scans its database of past experiences for similar patterns. If it finds a match, it projects a solution instantly, which you experience as a "gut feeling" or "hunch." As Nobel laureate **Herbert Simon** famously put it: _"The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition."_

### 📝 Key Insight
- **The Validity Condition:** Intuition is not magical; it is statistical. Therefore, it is only trustworthy under two specific conditions (as identified by **Daniel Kahneman** and **Gary Klein**):
1. **Regularity:** The environment must be sufficiently stable and predictable (like Chess or Firefighting, unlike the Stock Market).
2. **Practice:** The individual must have had a massive amount of practice (feedback loops) in that specific environment to learn the regularities. If these conditions are met, intuition is "Expertise." If they are not (e.g., a "gut feeling" about a crypto investment), intuition is merely "Bias" or "Noise."
