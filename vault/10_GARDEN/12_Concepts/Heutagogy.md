### 💡 Definition
> The study of **Self-Determined Learning**. Coined by Stewart Hase and Chris Kenyon (2000), it goes a step further than **Andragogy** (Self-Directed Learning).

- **The Spectrum:**
    
    1. **Pedagogy (Child):** The teacher determines _what_, _how_, and _when_ to learn. (Dependence).
        
    2. **Andragogy (Adult):** The learner is self-directed but relies on a mentor for structure and guidance. (Independence).
        
    3. **Heutagogy (Self):** The learner determines the path, the assessment, and the goal itself. The teacher (if present) is merely a resource or "guide on the side." (Interdependence/Autonomy).
        

In a heutagogical environment, the focus shifts from **Content** (transferring knowledge) to **Process** (developing the capability to learn).

### 📝 Key Insight
*  **Competency vs. Capability:** Heutagogy distinguishes between being "competent" and being "capable."
    
    - **Competency:** The ability to perform a task to a set standard in a known environment (e.g., passing a test).
        
    - **Capability:** The ability to use competency in novel, unfamiliar situations. It involves self-efficacy, creativity, and adaptability.
        
- **Double-Loop Learning:** While standard education focuses on _Single-Loop Learning_ (fixing the error to achieve the goal), Heutagogy emphasizes **Double-Loop Learning** (questioning the goal itself). The learner doesn't just ask "How do I solve this problem?" but "Is this the right problem to solve?"
