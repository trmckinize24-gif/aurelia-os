### 💡 Definition
> A high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** (released in 1991). Its core design philosophy is encapsulated in the aphorism: _"Readability counts."_ Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of **Significant Indentation** (whitespace) instead of braces/semicolons. It is "batteries included," meaning its standard library is vast and capable of handling everything from web requests to zip files right out of the box. Technically, it is **Dynamically Typed** (variable types are checked at runtime) and **Garbage Collected** (memory is managed automatically).

### 📝 Key Insight
**Optimization for Human Time, Not Machine Time:** Python is arguably the slowest major language in terms of raw execution speed (often 10-100x slower than C++). However, it is the most popular language in the world because it optimizes for **Development Speed**.

- In the modern era, cloud compute is cheap, but engineer salaries are expensive. Python allows engineers to write logic in minutes that would take hours in lower-level languages.
    
- **The "Glue" Superpower:** When performance _does_ matter (like in AI or Aerospace simulations), Python acts as a "wrapper" or "glue" for fast C/C++ libraries (like NumPy or PyTorch). You write easy Python code, but under the hood, it triggers highly optimized C code. This makes it the lingua franca of Data Science and Machine Learning.
