### 💡 Definition
> The set of recurrent selection pressures and environmental problems that shaped a given adaptation over deep time. Coined by John Bowlby, the EEA is not a specific place (like "The African Savanna") or a specific time (like 50,000 BC), but a **statistical composite** of the conditions an organism's ancestors faced. For humans, the EEA roughly corresponds to the Pleistocene era—small, nomadic, kin-based groups navigating a natural world of scarcity, predation, and intense social interdependence. It is the "design specification" for the human mind.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **The Discordance Hypothesis:** The core utility of the EEA concept is to highlight **Evolutionary Mismatch**. Our modern environment (cities, infinite calories, digital screens, anonymity) differs radically from the EEA. Because evolution is slow and cultural change is fast, we are essentially "fish out of water"—suffering from "diseases of civilization" (anxiety, obesity, loneliness) because our software (instincts) is trying to run on hardware (environment) it was not designed for. We possess Stone Age brains in a Silicon Age world.
