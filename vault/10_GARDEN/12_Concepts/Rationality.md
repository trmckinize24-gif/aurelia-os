### 💡 Definition
> The use of knowledge to attain goals. In its broadest sense, rationality is the discipline of ensuring your "map" matches the "territory" (Epistemic Rationality) and making decisions that maximize your values given your constraints (Instrumental Rationality). It is not the absence of emotion, but the regulation of it. As **Steven Pinker** defines it, rationality is a set of "cognitive tools"—logic, probability, and critical thinking—that allow us to overcome the limitations of our raw intuition. It is the mechanism by which we move from "believing what feels good" to "believing what is true."

### 📝 Key Insight
* **The "Gadget" of Reason:** Pinker argues that humans are not "irrational" by nature; we are _ecologically_ rational for a hunter-gatherer environment (where trusting a vivid anecdote about a tiger is safer than looking at statistics). However, modern rationality—the kind required to understand vaccines, democracy, or economics—is **unnatural**. It is a piece of "cultural software" that we must deliberately install and maintain. We are born with the _capacity_ for reason, but we must _learn_ the tools of rationality (like Bayesian updating) to override our primitive bugs.
