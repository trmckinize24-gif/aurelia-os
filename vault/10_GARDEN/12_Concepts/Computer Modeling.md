### 💡 Definition
> The process of creating a mathematical representation of a real-world system, object, or phenomenon using computer software. It involves abstracting physical reality into variables, equations, and algorithmic rules. While a **Model** is the static description (the code/equations), a **Simulation** is the dynamic running of that model over time. It allows scientists and engineers to study complex systems—from the aerodynamics of a wing to the spread of a virus—in a risk-free virtual environment.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **"All Models Are Wrong, Some Are Useful":** This aphorism by statistician **George Box** is the golden rule of the discipline. No computer model can ever capture 100% of reality (that would require a 1:1 map of the universe). Therefore, the art of modeling is **Judicious Simplification**—knowing which variables can be ignored to save computational power without compromising the result. A model is not "truth"; it is a tool for decision-making. If it predicts the weather accurately enough to save crops, it is "valid," even if it ignores the butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil.
