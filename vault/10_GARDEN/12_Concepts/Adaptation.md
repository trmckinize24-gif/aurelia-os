### 💡 Definition
> A functional trait (anatomical, physiological, or behavioral) that has evolved through **Natural Selection** because it contributed to an organism's survival and reproductive success in a specific ancestral environment. An adaptation is not a "perfect solution" but a "better-than-the-alternative" solution derived from random variation. It is the result of the blind algorithmic process of evolution solving a specific engineering problem (e.g., the eye solving for photon detection, or calluses solving for friction).

### 📝 Key Insight
* **The Time Lag (Mismatch):** A critical nuance often missed is that adaptations are solutions to _past_ environments, not current ones. We are "executed" code written for the Pleistocene. This leads to **Evolutionary Mismatch**: traits that were once adaptive (e.g., the drive to consume high-calorie sugar/fat for famine protection) can become maladaptive in a modern environment (leading to obesity and diabetes). We are navigating a digital world with a hunter-gatherer operating system.
