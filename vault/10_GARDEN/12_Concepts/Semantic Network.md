### 💡 Definition
> A graphic notation for representing knowledge in patterns of interconnected nodes and arcs. Think of it as a **Mind Map for Machines**. In this structure, **Nodes** represent concepts (e.g., "Bird," "Wings," "Animal"), and **Edges** (lines) represent the semantic relationships between them (e.g., "Is-A," "Has-A"). Instead of storing data in a rigid spreadsheet (Rows/Columns), the brain and advanced AI store data as a giant, messy spiderweb. To "know" what a sparrow is, you don't look up a definition; you look at its position in the web—connected to "Bird," "Small," and "Brown."

### 📝 Key Insight
* **Spreading Activation (The Ripple Effect):** The magic of a semantic network is how it retrieves information. It uses a mechanism called **Spreading Activation**. Imagine the network is a web of lights. When you think of the concept "Fire" (turning that node on), electricity flows down the wire to light up "Hot," "Red," and "Danger." This is why hearing the word "Doctor" makes you recognize the word "Nurse" faster than "Bread." The concept "Nurse" was already half-lit (primed) because it is close to "Doctor" in your semantic network. Intelligence, therefore, is largely about having a densely connected network where the right path lights up automatically.
