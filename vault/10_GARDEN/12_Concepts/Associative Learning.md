### 💡 Definition
> The fundamental cognitive process by which an organism learns that two events occur together. It is the mechanism the brain uses to map the causal structure of the environment. In **Neuroscience**, this is physically instantiated via **Hebbian Learning**: "Neurons that fire together, wire together." When the representation of Stimulus A repeatedly activates just before the representation of Stimulus B, the synaptic connection between them strengthens, allowing A to eventually trigger the anticipation of B without external input.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **From Correlation to Prediction:** While often taught simply as "Pavlov's Dog" (bell rings $\to$ salivate), the evolutionary function of associative learning is **Future Simulation**. It transforms the brain from a reactive engine into a proactive prediction machine. By learning associations, the organism minimizes "surprise" (entropy). If you can associate the rustle of grass with a predator, you can act _before_ the predator strikes. Thus, associative learning is the bedrock of all survival intelligence.
