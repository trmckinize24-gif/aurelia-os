### 💡 Definition
> The momentary reversal of electrical potential across a plasma membrane (from -70mV to +40mV) that occurs when a nerve cell is stimulated. It is the fundamental unit of neural communication—the "bit" of the brain. Mechanistically, it is caused by the rapid opening of **Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels** ($Na^+$ rushes in), followed by the opening of **Potassium Channels** ($K^+$ rushes out). This electrical spike travels down the axon like a burning fuse, triggering the release of neurotransmitters at the synapse.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **The "All-or-None" Law:** The most profound engineering feature of the action potential is that it is a **binary signal**. A neuron either fires completely or not at all; there is no such thing as a "strong" or "weak" action potential, only a strong or weak _frequency_ of firing. This means the brain uses a **Rate Code** (frequency modulation) to transmit intensity. Biology solved the problem of signal degradation over long distances (e.g., spine to toe) by digitizing the signal—ensuring the "1" received at the end is identical to the "1" sent from the source.
