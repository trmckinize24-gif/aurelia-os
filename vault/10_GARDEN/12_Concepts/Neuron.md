### 💡 Definition
> The electrically excitable cell that functions as the fundamental working unit of the brain and nervous system.

>Structurally, it acts as a polarized input-output device: it receives chemical signals via **Dendrites** (the input terminals), integrates them in the **Soma** (cell body), and if the aggregate signal crosses a specific threshold, transmits an electrical pulse down the **Axon** (the output cable) to the next cell. There are roughly 86 billion neurons in the human brain, forming a network of staggering complexity.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **The Biological Logic Gate:** A single neuron is effectively a biological calculator performing a continuous "If/Then" operation. It engages in **Summation** (adding up all the excitatory and inhibitory inputs). If the sum is positive enough (Excitatory > Inhibitory), it fires. If not, it remains silent. This mechanism allows the brain to make complex decisions by layering millions of these simple "voting" units. It is the physical hardware that permits the software of "thought" to run.
