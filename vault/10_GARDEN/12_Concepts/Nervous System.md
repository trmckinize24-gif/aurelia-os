### 💡 Definition
> The high-speed, electrochemical communication network of the biological organism. It is the primary control system responsible for collecting sensory input, processing that information (integration), and triggering motor output.

>Structurally, it is divided into the **Central Nervous System (CNS)** (brain and spinal cord) and the **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)** (nerves connecting to limbs and organs). Functionally, it acts as the interface between the organism and the environment, converting physical energy (light, sound, pressure) into neural code.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **Built for Movement, Not Truth:** The evolutionary purpose of a nervous system is **motricity** (movement). As evidenced by the _Sea Squirt_ (which digests its own brain once it finds a permanent rock to attach to), a brain is only necessary for an organism that must navigate a dynamic environment. Therefore, our cognitive faculties (memory, planning, reason) are not designed for abstract philosophy; they are "add-ons" to a motor control system designed to move the organism toward food and away from danger.
