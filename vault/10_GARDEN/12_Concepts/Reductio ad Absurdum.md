### 💡 Definition
> Latin for "reduction to absurdity." A form of argument which attempts to disprove a statement by showing that it inevitably leads to a ridiculous, absurd, or contradictory conclusion. In **Formal Logic** and **Mathematics**, it is known as _Proof by Contradiction_: to prove $P$, you assume $\neg P$ (not P) is true, then show that this assumption implies a mathematical impossibility (like $1 = 0$), thereby proving $P$ must be true. In **Rhetoric**, it is used to expose the hidden flaws in a general principle by applying it to an extreme case.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **The Boundary Condition Test:** Think of _Reductio ad Absurdum_ as "Edge Case Testing" in software engineering. A rule might look fine under normal operating conditions, but if you push the inputs to infinity or zero (the absurd extremes) and the system outputs garbage, the rule is fundamentally broken. For example, if someone argues "You should never lie," the _Reductio_ is: "What if a murderer asks for the location of your friend?" If the answer is "Tell the truth," the moral system collapses into absurdity. This forces the refinement of the rule from "Never lie" to "Never lie, except to prevent harm."
