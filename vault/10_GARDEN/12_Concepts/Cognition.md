# ⚛️ Cognition

**🔗 Related:** [[Information Processing Theory]], [[Perception]], [[Memory]], [[Decision Making]], [[Functionalism]], [[Metacognition]], [[Embodied Cognition]], [[Artificial Intelligence]]

### 💡 Definition
> The mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses. In its broadest, substrate-independent sense, cognition is **[[Information Processing]]**. It is the set of [[Algorithm]]s that transforms raw data (Input) into actionable models or decisions (Output).

- **In Biology:** It involves the transduction of physical energy (light/sound) into neural code, which is then integrated to update the organism's internal model of the world.
- **In [[Machine Learning]]:** It involves the ingestion of vectors (data), the adjustment of weights (learning), and the generation of predictions. In both cases, cognition is not a magic "ghost in the machine"; it is the functional manipulation of symbols or patterns to solve problems.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **[[Substrate Independence]]:** The most powerful insight in modern [[Cognitive Science]] (championed by philosophers like **[[Daniel Dennett]]** and **Hilary Putnam**) is that cognition is likely **Substrate Independent**. Just as the software "Microsoft Excel" can run on a silicon chip, a vacuum tube computer, or (theoretically) a system of water pipes and valves, "Cognition" is a functional structure that does not _require_ biological neurons. It requires only a system capable of representation and computation. This is the foundational axiom of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): if we can replicate the _function_ of the brain, we don't need the _tissue_.
