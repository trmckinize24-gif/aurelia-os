# ⚛️ Task Switching

### 💡 Definition
> The executive function of shifting the cognitive focus from one goal-directed behavior to another. While often confused with "multitasking," neuroscience confirms that the brain cannot process two cognitively demanding tasks simultaneously. Instead, it performs **Rapid Serial Processing**—quickly toggling between tasks. Every switch requires the brain to "save the state" of the current task, inhibit the old rule set, and "load the state" of the new task. This process incurs a metabolic and temporal penalty known as the **Switching Cost**.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **The High Cost of "Quick Checks":** As [[Cal Newport]] emphasizes (drawing on research by Sophie Leroy), the danger is not just the time lost _during_ the switch, but the **Attention Residue** left behind. When you switch from writing code to checking an email, your attention does not follow you completely; a fragment of your cognitive resources remains "stuck" on the unfinished email. This residue reduces your available cognitive capacity for the primary task, effectively lowering your functional IQ. **Slow Productivity** argues that to maximize output, one must minimize switches. True productivity is not doing more things faster (which increases switching costs), but doing fewer things for longer periods without interruption.
