### 💡 Definition
> The systematic manipulation of symbols according to a well-defined set of rules. In formal terms, computation is a mapping function $f$ that transforms an Input $x$ into an Output $y$ via a finite sequence of steps. While we associate it with silicon chips, computation is **Substrate Independent**; it can be performed by [[Neuron]]s, gears (Babbage Engine), [[DNA]], or a human with a pen and paper. If a physical system's states can be mapped to logical values (0 and 1) and its transitions follow an [[Algorithm]], it is performing computation.

### 📝 Key Insight
- **The Universal Machine:** The most profound insight in the history of computation is the **Church-Turing Thesis**. It posits that _any_ effectively calculable function can be computed by a **Turing Machine**. This implies that there are not different "kinds" of computation; there is only one universal logic. A supercomputer is just a faster Turing Machine than a pocket calculator, but they are theoretically equivalent in what they _can_ solve (given infinite time and memory). This universality is what allows us to model biology, physics, and economics all on the same device.
