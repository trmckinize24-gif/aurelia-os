# ⚛️ Active Recall

### 💡 Definition
> The practice of recalling information from a learning session to strengthen memory and comprehension of the information. 
> 
>A principle of efficient learning which claims that the need to actively retrieve information from memory stimulates neural connectivity and retention far more effectively than passive review. In simple terms: **Testing is not just a measurement tool; it is a learning tool.** When you read a text, you are "recognizing" information. When you close the book and force yourself to recite it, you are "recalling" it. The latter signals to the brain that this information is metabolically expensive and necessary for survival, triggering stronger protein synthesis at the synapse.

### 📝 Key Insight
* [[Cal Newport]] credits active recall as his superpower when it came to getting straight A's in college and he advocates for the implementation of active recall sessions as a difficult and effortful practice that yields incredible results efficiently. 
* Daily Logs are designed to leverage the benefits of active recall for better memory and comprehension of the concepts extracted by the reading/learning session. 
* **The Illusion of Competence:** The primary reason active recall is avoided is that it feels "hard" and "unpleasant." Passive rereading feels "easy" and "fluent," leading to the false belief that you know the material (The Illusion of Competence). However, the efficacy of learning is often directly proportional to the cognitive strain involved (see **[[Desirable Difficulty]]**). If it feels easy, you probably aren't learning. The "struggle" to retrieve the answer _is_ the learning process itself.
