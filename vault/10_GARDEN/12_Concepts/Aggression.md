### 💡 Definition
> **1. The Evolutionary Psychology View (The Function):** Aggression is not a pathology, but a context-dependent **Adaptation**. It is a strategic behavioral solution to specific adaptive problems faced by our ancestors, such as co-opting resources, defending against attack, inflicting costs on intrasexual rivals, and deterring mates from infidelity. In this view, aggression is an investment of energy/risk that is deployed only when the potential payoff (in terms of fitness/status) outweighs the costs.
>**2. The Social Psychology View (The Mechanism):** Aggression is defined as behavior that is intended to harm another individual who does not wish to be harmed. It is often analyzed through the **General Aggression Model (GAM)**, which views aggressive acts as the result of an interaction between the **Person** (traits, biological sex, beliefs) and the **Situation** (provocation, frustration, pain). It distinguishes between **Hostile Aggression** (impulsive, emotional, driven by anger) and **Instrumental Aggression** (cold, calculated, driven by a goal other than pain, e.g., a robbery).

### 📝 Key Insight
**The Logic of Violence:** The most crucial synthesis of these two fields is the distinction between **Proactive** and **Reactive** aggression.

- **Reactive (Hot):** Is a "Threat Response" system (Social Psych calls this Hostile). It shares circuitry with fear and is about _defense_.
- **Proactive (Cold):** Is a "Goal-Directed" system (Social Psych calls this Instrumental). It is about _predation_ and _dominance_.
- Evolutionary theory predicts that **males** will overwhelmingly engage in Proactive Aggression (war, mugging, homicide) compared to females, because the variance in reproductive success is higher for males, making "high risk / high reward" strategies viable. This explains the **Young Male Syndrome**: the universal demographic fact that violence peaks in men between ages 15-25 (peak mating competition).
