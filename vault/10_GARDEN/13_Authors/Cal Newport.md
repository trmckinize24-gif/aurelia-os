# 👤 Cal Newport

### 📝 Profile & Context
> A Professor of Computer Science at Georgetown University and a cultural critic. Unlike most productivity writers who focus on "hacks" or "motivation," Newport approaches work from an **Engineering** perspective. He views the modern knowledge worker's environment (Slack, Email, Social Media) as a poorly optimized distributed system that thrashes resources (attention). His central thesis across all his work is that **Focus is the new IQ** in the digital economy, and that we must be "digital minimalists"—curating our tools rather than being used by them.

### 📚 Key Works (In Vault)
- **[[Deep Work]]** (The Manifesto on Focus).
- **[[So Good They Can't Ignore You]]** (Debunking the "Passion Hypothesis").
- **[[Digital Minimalism]]** (A philosophy of technology use).
- **[[A World Without Email]]** (Diagnosing the "Hyperactive Hive Mind").
- **[[Slow Productivity]]** (His most recent work on sustainable output).

### ⚛️ Core Concepts
- **[[The Passion Trap]]:** The argument that "Follow Your Passion" is bad advice. Passion is a side effect of mastery, not a prerequisite. You should instead focus on building rare and valuable skills (**[[Career Capital]]**).
- **[[Digital Minimalism]]:** A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.
- **[[The Hyperactive Hive Mind]]:** A workflow centered around ongoing conversation fueled by unstructured and unscheduled messages. Newport argues this destroys cognitive capacity.
- **[[Time Blocking]]:** The tactical antidote to the Hive Mind. Instead of working from a "To-Do List" (which is reactive), you work from a schedule (which is proactive), assigning every minute of the day a job.
