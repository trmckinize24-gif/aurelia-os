# 👤 Charles Darwin

### 📝 Profile & Context
> The "Newton of Biology." Darwin is the central figure of **Evolutionary Naturalism**. He was a reluctant revolutionary who spent decades amassing mountains of empirical evidence (barnacles, pigeons, orchids) before publishing his theory, knowing it would topple the social order. His genius was not just in noticing evolution (which others had done), but in identifying the **Mechanism** (Natural Selection) that could drive it without divine intervention. He represents the triumph of **Inductive Reasoning**—building a theory from the ground up based on observation.

### ⚛️ Core Concepts
- **[[Population Thinking]]:** The shift from viewing a species as a "perfect type" with errors (Platonic essentialism) to viewing the _variation itself_ as the reality. The average is an abstraction; the diversity is the fuel for evolution.
- **[[Sexual Selection]]:** His second great mechanism, introduced to explain traits that _reduce_ survival odds (like the Peacock's tail) but increase mating success.
- **[[Pangenesis]]:** (Historical Note). Darwin’s failed attempt to explain heredity before genetics was discovered. He believed "gemmules" from the body migrated to the gonads. (Link this to [[Gregor Mendel]] to show the "Modern Synthesis" bridge).
- **[[Substrate Neutrality]]:** (Implicit). Though he dealt with biology, his logic was algorithmic. The process of selection works on _any_ system with variation, heredity, and differential success (memes, code, markets).
