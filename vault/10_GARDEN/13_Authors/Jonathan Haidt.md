# 👤 Jonathan Haidt

### 📝 Profile & Context
> A social psychologist at New York University's Stern School of Business, Haidt is a central figure in the field of **Moral Psychology**. His work focuses on the intuitive foundations of morality and how they vary across cultures and political lines. Unlike the rationalist tradition (which views morality as a logic puzzle), Haidt views morality as an evolutionary adaptation—a set of emotional "taste buds" designed to suppress selfishness and create cooperative societies. He is also a prominent cultural critic, diagnosing the rise of political polarization and the mental health crisis in Gen Z through the lens of evolutionary mismatch and the decline of "play-based childhood."
