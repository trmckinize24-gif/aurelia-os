## 🧬 Core Principle
**The Crane (Fundamental Truth):**
*Define the core axiom or mechanism here. What is the single most important takeaway? Avoid skyhooks; describe the mechanistic reality.*

## 🏗️ The Architecture (Logic Flow)

### 1. INPUT LAYER: Context & Signal
* **Goal:** *What is the problem, raw data, or starting state?*
* **Key Components:**
    * *Component A*
    * *Component B*
* **Protocol/Observation:**
    * *Describe the initial conditions or the environment.*

### 2. PROCESSING LAYER: Mechanism & Analysis
* **Goal:** *How does the system work? What are the dynamics?*
* **The Mechanism:**
    * *Step 1*
    * *Step 2*
* **Incentives/Pressures:**
    * *What selection pressures or logic gates are active here?*

### 3. LOGIC LAYER: Synthesis & Matrix
* **Goal:** *Connect this concept to other mental models.*
* **Connections:**
    * *Relation to [Concept A]*
    * *Contrast with [Concept B]*
* **The Gap/Conflict:**
    * *Where does the current understanding fail or conflict?*

### 4. OUTPUT LAYER: Conclusion & Application
* **Goal:** *What is the actionable result or final argument?*
* **The "So What?":**
    * *Implication 1*
    * *Implication 2*
* **Action Item:**
    * *Next step or specific application of this knowledge.*
