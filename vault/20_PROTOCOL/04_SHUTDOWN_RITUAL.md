# ⚙️ 04_Shutdown_Ritual

## 📋 The Sequence
- [ ] Trigger: Work Session is ending 
- [ ] Set Recursive Pointer - Write down the exact starting action for the next session of work. This is the recursive element. The end of one session informs the beginning of the next. 
- [ ] Serialize State - Regardless of device or materials, close tabs, save progress, or put away materials.
- [ ] Verify Ledger - Quickly scan Calendar/Docs for immediate "fires" tomorrow morning. (check ordered queue document)
- [ ] Terminate Session - Stand up, step away, and audibly say: "I'll call it a day"

## 🧠 System Logic
> The inspiration of designing this ritual comes from [[Cal Newport]]. When he was a guest on the [[Huberman Lab Podcast]] by [[Andrew Huberman]] he spoke about his top 3 strategies for enhancing productivity and focus. 1 of these strategies was implementing a shutdown ritual, in order to close the loop on the workday, which frees cognition for other tasks unrelated to work. I strive to be present with the people in my life and to be aware of my experience as a whole when not accomplishing tasks for the sake of my own success or enjoyment. Temperance is a virtue that is core to the AURELIA philosophy, especially the elements of the philosophy derived from my reading of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and other [[Stoicism]] material.
