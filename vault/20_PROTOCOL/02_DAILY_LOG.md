## 🧠 System Logic
> This protocol was designed with my erratic reading habits in mind. I consistently consume information across various interrelated disciplines such as cognitive science, evolutionary, biology, philosophy of mind, and psychology. The problem is that I enjoy jumping from book to book, concept to concept, and across disciplines. To help me extract value from this chaos, I started taking atomic notes and that led me to the discovery of Obsidian for wiki linked notetaking. Since then I have integrated my Obsidian workflow for note taking with the entirety of the AURELIA OS website, and I am now able to grow my digital garden and portfolio right from Obsidian seamlessly and extremely fast. If you are interested in purchasing a customized website such as AURELIA OS, that is tailored to your personal style and needs with full Obsidian integration, consider checking out the SERVICES page in the navigation menu!
