# ⚙️ 03_Slow_Productivity

## 📋 The Sequence
- [ ] Trigger: Anytime I am engaged in knowledge work (reading, writing, digital work, creative work etc...)
- [ ] [[Do Fewer Things]] - Do not put too many irons in the fire! Say no to more commitments BEFORE overwhelmed by workload. 
- [ ] [[Work at a Natural Pace]] - Do not fall into the trap of believing that pseudo-productivity is useful or produces quality output. Take more time, extend deadlines, and stay ahead of things instead of always being stressed by unrealistic deadlines. Obviously stay true to your commitments, but seek a balance, because chronic stress is a literal killer. You will get more done like this anyway. 
- [ ] [[Obsess Over Quality]] - 1 good project is worth 1,000 superficial tasks completed. Break things down into smaller more manageable tasks and watch projects come to fruition with amazing quality, quality that I can be truly proud of. 

## 🧠 System Logic
> Being productive is meaningless unless the output generated by our work is actually fulfilling and contributes to the positive well-being of our own lives and the lives of those we can affect.
